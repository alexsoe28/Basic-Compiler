1.  Overview

An intermediate language is a very low level language used by a
compiler to perform optimizations and other changes before emitting
final assembly language for some particular machine.  It generally
matches common assembly language statement semantics, but in a typeful
manner.

SYNOPSIS
     oc [-ly] [-@ flag...]  [-D string] program.oc

All of the requirements for all previous projects are included in this
project.  For any input file called program.oc emit an intermediate
language file called program.oil, which can then be compiled into
assembly language using gcc.

              Figure 2.  Type declarations in oc and oil

2.  Intermediate Language

The intermediate language chosen here looks very much like C, except
that, for the most part, each oil statement should be capable of
translating into a single assembly language instruction, or only a
few.  Unlike most assembly languages, oil is typed as to basic data
types, namely char, int, and pointer.  The size of the int and pointer
types are dependent on the underlying architecture.  The char type is
only used in strings.

The basic grammar of oil is given in Figure 1, and uses the same
metanotation as was used in the definition of oc.  Figure 2 shows the
relationship between types in oc and the corresponding C-compatible
types in oil.  The extra types listed in Figure 1 but not in Figure 2
are used only when the address operator (&) is applied to take the
address of a field selection, which is then dereferenced when applied.
The intermediate language has two datatypes:  integers and pointers.
Characters only appear in integers and strings.
2.1  Program and Function Structure

An oil program is structured in a way similar to C, except that it
looks more like assembly language.  All code is either aligned with
the left margin or indented by 8 spaces.

 (a) Structure definitions come first, with the struct keyword and
     closing brace left-aligned, and the fields indented, as in:

        struct foo {
                char** foo_string_array;
                struct foo* f_foo_pointer;
        };

 (b) Then all string constants are listed in the order they appear in
     the program.  They are unlikely to be able to be used as
     immediate operands in assembly language.  Global declarations are
     all left-aligned, as in:

        char* s1 = "Hello, world!\n";

 (c) Then all global variable declarations that appeared in the
     program, but without initialization, because in C, static
     initialization is done at compile time.

 (d) Finally, functions are emitted with one parameter per line.  The
     function name and the two braces are left aligned, as are label
     statements, but everything else is indented, as in:

        int add (
                int _1_a,
                int _1_b)
        {
                int i2 = _1_a + _1_b;
                return i2;
        }

2.2  Statements

Statements are all indented, except for labels, and all declarations
of local variables must be initialized.  Expressions other than calls
are restricted to three-address instructions, with a destination and
at most two sources.

 (a) A label is emitted unindented on a line by itself.  It consists
     of a keyword from the source language followed by the coordinates
     taken from the node.

        while_4_20_9:;

 (b) A goto statement may be conditional or unconditional, and if
     conditional is preceded by an if and an operand (possibly
     complemented) in parentheses.

                goto while_4_20_9;
                if (!b36) goto while_4_29_9;

 (c) A return statement may or may not have an operand, depending on
     the requirements of the original oc program.

                return _5_foobar;
                return;

 (d) An assignment statement takes an expression as an operand.  A
     type is present if the identifier has not previously been
     declared, and absent if it has.

                int i5 = _2_n + 45;
                _2_n = i5;
                char* a6 = &_3_a[i6];
                *a6 = i7

 (e) A function call may only have operands in parentheses, but may
     have as many as appropriate.  A void function has no assignment
     on the left.  All other functions must have it, and the result is
     placed into a temporary.
2.3  Expressions

Expressions are simple and restricted to three-address code.

 (a) Binary operators are the same as they are in oc and have already
     been type checked.  As in C, 0 means false and anything else
     means true.  The unary operators are also the same.

 (b) Address computation for indexing and field selection is taken
     care of by the back end, alghough a type checker would normally
     assign offsets of fields in structures and offsets of local
     variables from the frame pointer.

      (i) The type of a subscript address is the same as the type of
          the array.  So if we have char** _3_a, then a subscripting
          operation might be:
             char** a5 = &_3_a[_3_i];
          and when it is used, a5 must be dereferenced, as in:
             _3_n = *a5;
             *a5 = _3_n;
          depending on whether the dereference is an lvalue or an
          rvalue.

     (ii) The type of a selection has one more level of pointer than
          the declaration of a field.  So if a struct has a field
          char** foo_bar;, then the selection might be:
             char*** a9 = &_3_ptr->foo_bar;

 (c) Figure 2 show the types in oc and their corresponding types in
     oil.  Note that the asterisk representing a pointer cuddles up
     against the following identifier, not against the type.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
                 Figure 3.  Summary of name mangling

2.4  Name Mangling

Assembly language generally uses a completely flat symbol table, so
names need to be mangled in order to avoid clashing global names with
various local scopes and the C library to which a program is linked.
Figure 3 shows the fprintf(3) format items and arguments to be used to
mangle a name.

 (a) All structure names, function names, and global variables will be
     presented as is, ``foo''.  Global names belong to block 0.

 (b) Local names will be prefixed with an underscore with a block
     number between the underscores, as in ``_1_n''.  Local names
     belong to blocks whose number is greater than 0.

 (c) Statement labels are emitted with a keyword from the language
     followed by the file number, line number, and offset from the
     token.  The following keywords are used:  ``while'', before a
     while expression;  ``break'', the statement to transfer to for a
     false test;  ``else'', to branch to if the if-test is false and
     there is an else;  and ``fi'', to skip the else part.

 (d) Field names are prefixed with the name of the structure to which
     they belong.  So a field from struct foo { int ix; };  would be
     called foo_ix.

 (e) Virtual registers are just assigned numbers in sequence
     throughout the entire program starting with 1, 2, 3, etc.  The
     letter used is i for an int, s for a STRINGCON address, p for a
     direct data pointer, and a for an indirect (dereferenceable)
     address pointing at data.  E.g., i2, s3, p4, a5.

 (f) Indirect addresses are the result of evaluating selections, which
     must be dereferenced when used.  All other addresses are used
     directly.

                int* a6 = &_3_array[_3_i];
                char** a8 = &_3_foo->f_foo_bar;

3.  Code Emission

Code is emitted from the AST with the benefit of the the symbol table
and type checker.  Since the suffix oil is not recognized by gcc, in
order to make it compile the code, the -x option must be used.  Figure
4 shows a shell script that will compile into an executable, given the
name of the executable.

The file oclib.h is bilingual for both oc and gcc.

 (a) Figure 5 shows the bilingual source file.

 (b) Figure 6 show the file preprocessed for oc, as will be seen by
     the oc compiler when included in an oc program.  Note that the
     #defines EOF and assert are not shown in the preprocessed
     figures, but will be used by the preprocessor to process an oc
     program.

 (c) Figure 7 shows it preprocessed for gcc, with names mangled names
     correctly when __OCLIB_C__ is defined, as is done when included
     from oclib.c.

Figures 8 and 9 show the code for oclib.c, the library written in C.
3.1  Top Level Description

First, a prolog is emitted, then the children of the root are
traversed in their own sequence to build the various parts of the
program.

 (a) Then all structure definitions are traversed and output as
     described above, with names mangled, and fields properly
     indented.

 (b) Next, all string constants are given names as described above.
     This should not require a complete tree traversal.  Retrofit
     either the construction of the AST or the type checking module to
     put all STRINGCON AST nodes into a queue.

 (c) Then all global variables, immediate children of the root, and
     output, with any initializen given.  Initialization must be
     simple as per the grammar in project 3.

 (d) Then all functions are output, as described below.
3.2  Emitting Functions and Statements

Function emission is done by a complete depth-first mostly post-order
traversal of the AST for that function.  Prototypes need not be
emitted.  They are used only in type checking.

 (a) Output the function's return type, name, and mangled parameter
     names.  Mangle the parameter names using the block number the
     function created.

 (b) Following that, indented, are the declarations of all of the
     parameters.

 (c) An opening brace, unindented, at the start of the function's
     body, and a closing brace, unindented, after the function is
     finished.

 (d) A block simply has its children traversed.

 (e) A while has two children.  For the while and break labels, both
     use the serial number of the while token.
      (i) Emit:  while_%d_%d_%d:;  unindented.
     (ii) Emit the first child, unless it is an operand.
     (iii) Emit:  if (!operand) goto break_%d_%d_%d;
     (iv) Emit the statement.
      (v) Emit:  goto while_%d_%d_%d;
     (vi) Emit:  break_%d_%d_%d:;  unindented.

 (f) For an if-else statement, do the following:
      (i) Emit the first expression, unless it is an operand.
     (ii) Emit:  if (!operand) goto else_%d_%d_%d;
     (iii) Emit the second child (consequent statement).
     (iv) Emit:  goto fi_%d_%d_%d;
      (v) Emit:  else_%d_%d_%d:;  unindented.
     (vi) Emit the third child (alternate statement).
     (vii) Emit fi_%d_%d_%d:;  unindented.

 (g) For an if with no else, do the following:
      (i) Emit the first expression, unless it is an operand.
     (ii) Emit:  if (!operand) goto fi_%d_%d_%d;
     (iii) Emit the second child (consequent statement).
     (iv) Emit fi_%d_%d_%d:;  unindented.

 (h) If a return statement has an expression, emit the expression,
     unless it is an operand, then return the operand.  If not, just
     return.
3.3  Emitting Expressions

Expressions are always emitted using a strict depth-first post-order
traversal, accumulating values into virtual registers.  This results
in some redundant virtual registers, but the back end can use copy
propagation to remove them during register allocation.

 (a) In each case of generating code into an operand, generate a
     declaration of a virtual register with the appropriate letter, i,
     s, a, or p, and assign it the value of the expression thus
     evaluated.

 (b) The binary operators are the same in both oc and oil, and after
     emitting an instruction, record the register number in the AST
     node itself.  This will require adding yet another field.
     Similarly, handle the unary operators.  Example:
        int i5 = _3_n + 1;

 (c) An allocator uses a call to xcalloc() to allocate the storage,
     based on the type of allocator, for some structure type T and
     pointer number i:

      (i) `new' TYPEID :
          Emit:  struct T* pi = xcalloc (1, sizeof (struct T));

     (ii) `new' `string' `(' expression `)' :
          Emit the expression, unless it is an operand.
          Emit:  char* pi = xcalloc (opnd, sizeof (char));

     (iii) `new' basetype `[' expression `]' :
          Emit the expression, unless it is an operand.
          Emit one of the following, depending on the basetype:
             · char* pi = xcalloc (opnd, sizeof (char));
             · int* pi = xcalloc (opnd, sizeof (int));
             · char** pi = xcalloc (opnd, sizeof (char*));
             · struct T** pi = xcalloc (opnd, sizeof (struct T*));

 (d) For a function call, evaluate each of the arguments into
     registers, and generate the call instruction.  A void function is
     just called.  A non-void function has its result captured into a
     register.

 (e) An INTCON may be emitted as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal
     number, as in C.  A CHARCON is emitted as is.  The constants null
     and false are emitted as the literal 0, and true is emitted as
     the literal 1.

 (f) Constants (except strings) and variables are never captured in
     registers, but instead are used as immediate operands.

4.  An Example

Figure 10 contains a sample oc program.  Figure 11 contains the output
file generated from it, except that the code generated from the
#include header file has been omitted.  It is assumed that cpp here
has recognized this file as the fifth file in sequence and that the
header file has generated 11 blocks so that the code presented is the
12th block.
