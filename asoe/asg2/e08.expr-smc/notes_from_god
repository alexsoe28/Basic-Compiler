Append the following loop to your main from asg1

while yylex hasnt return EOF
	call yylex
	print yylval to .tok file (using astree::print)

modify lexer.l so that it has regular expressions for the tokens for the oc lang

use the parser from code/utility-code to generate token types

what you need to copy over:
parser.y, lexer.l, astree.*, lyutils.*
